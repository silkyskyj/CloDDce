I am a programmer who runs a small software company in Japan. Aside from my main job, I customize this OSS as a personal hobby. In this way, OSS can be developed by individuals as they like while respecting copyrights and rules. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the original developer, Stefan Rothdach, for creating and releasing this wonderful software.
