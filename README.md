A dynamic campaign engine & dynamic mission for IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover Blitz + Desert Wings Release (Current Version 0.6.2 04/25/2025)
https://github.com/silkyskyj/il2dce/releases

Fixed:
 - not work AdditionalStationaries in Campaign
 - not carried over GroundGroup disable & position\[Campaign StrictMode\]
 - if a group's units are reduced to 0, they will disappear forever\[Campaign StrictMode\]
 - Temporary solution to CloD specification where AI aircraft will not take off if AirGroup is set idle. (0.6.1)

*In an existing campaign, the new settings will take effect from the next after next campaign mission. The next campaign mission will be created with the previous settings.

Artillery (The ship kind and the land kind and the anti-air kind) https://forum.il2sturmovik.com/topic/90957-artillery-the-ship-kind-and-the-land-kind-and-the-anti-air-kind/
Ship Speed and Convoys (Boat Racing) https://forum.il2sturmovik.com/topic/90951-ship-speed-and-convoys-boat-racing/
AI Skill Settings https://forum.il2sturmovik.com/topic/91024-ai-skill-settings/

*There are cases where files are not properly overwritten by the installer. I recommend uninstalling the old version -> deleting the IL2DCE folder in Program Files -> reinstalling.
*please re-import any mission files that you have previously imported.
* \[Kill count may differ from game default\] sorry, since the method for counting the number of kills in the game has not been made public, we cannot guarantee that the numbers will be the same. The calculation method is different.This is the current specification of IL2DCE. If you don't like this number, please use CloD PlayerStat API statType 1. 

04/22/2025 In the future, please refrain from posting any bugs or similar posts that have no evidence of the bugs described in this topic, as I cannot determine whether they are bugs, misunderstandings, or other reasons.  If you post something like that or if you do not understand that it is AGPL, I may hide it, so we appreciate your understanding.

* If there is a release, it will be done on the weekend. If there is a problem, please revert to the old version and use it for a while.

\[Current Bugs\]
 - There are cases where no text is displayed when viewing the battle results statistics.(the cause has been identified)

This is the silkyskyj version of IL2DCE.

IL2DCE was created and released by the original author, Stefan Rothdach, in 2011 and has been customized since.
I have forked the source code and customized it under the AGPL3.0 license terms, and am releasing it this time.

It is important to note that this add-in does not replace or attempt to compete with existing apps and add-ins such as Quick Mission, Single Mission, Campaign, and other apps and add-ins created by various developers, official development teams, and groups.
I hope you will choose it as one of the several ways to play the game.

In this release, we have focused on testing whether the program works properly, and have done little testing in abnormal cases.
(For example, most of the abnormality tests are for things like what happens if there is an unexpected format in the configuration file, what happens if the pilot name is 100 characters, etc.)
Please be aware of this.

This is a program that is available for free under the terms of AGPL3.0.
I don't guarantee operation, damages caused by use, the presence or absence of defects, bug fixes, feature additions, replies to inquiries, or explanations of features.
I'm very sorry, but please use this product only if you understand these points.

#sorry, I can't speak English, so I translate or paraphrase everything I read and write. Please understand that there may be some minor mistakes in the expressions.

I am a programmer who runs a small software company in Japan. Aside from my main job, I customize this OSS as a personal hobby. In this way, OSS can be developed by individuals as they like while respecting copyrights and rules. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the original developer, Stefan Rothdach, for creating and releasing this wonderful software.
